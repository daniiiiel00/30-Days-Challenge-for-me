# 📝 Advanced To-Do List App

A modern, responsive **To-Do List Web App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage daily tasks — all stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.  
It features **dark mode**, **task filtering**, and a **clean UI** for a better user experience.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-todo-list-app.git


cd advanced-todo-list-app


🧠 How It Works

When a user adds a task, it’s saved in the browser’s localStorage.

Each task object contains:

{
  id: 1,
  text: "Finish GitHub project",
  completed: false,
  createdAt: "2025-10-25T10:00:00Z"
}

Would you like me to add a **GitHub-ready live demo section** (including how to deploy on GitHub Pages automatically)?  
I can include the commands and deployment steps inside the README.
