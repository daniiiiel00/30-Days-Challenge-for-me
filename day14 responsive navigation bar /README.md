## How It Works

The navbar displays normally on larger screens.

On smaller screens, the menu becomes hidden and replaced by a hamburger icon.

When the icon is clicked, JavaScript toggles a class to show or hide the mobile menu with smooth transitions.

Colors

Font sizes

Animation duration

Menu position (left, right, full-screen overlay)
