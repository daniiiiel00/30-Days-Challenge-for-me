## How It Works

- The UI displays login and register panels with animated switching.

- JavaScript validates user input:

- Email format

- Password length

- Required fields

- A fake API simulates login/register requests with a short delay.

- Loading animation appears until the fake API responds.

- Success or error messages are displayed dynamically.

## Customization

You can customize:

- Colors

- Animations

- Layout style (glassmorphism, neuomorphism, minimal)

- Validation rules

- Fake API response time

- Transition styles
